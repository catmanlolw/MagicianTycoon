	Scripts: 
	(The smaller functions arent commented every line due to how small it is so I just summarized and explained its purpose above)
	
	ButtonModule = RUns whenever a button is pressed and retrieves the button touched along side the player.
	-Inside the buttonModules functions it finds out the corresponding functions from GameFunctions
	
	GameFunctions = This module has most of the game Buttons main code (Buttons only not the entire game) and is paired to work With ButtonModule.
	-Includes useful information like Shop prices, Merging tier list for hats, and the actual full functions for the buttons to work
	
	This game was created in September 2022 and finished in October 2022. 
	No one has touched it since then so the code and the game may have a few bugs.
	It is also not my best work, but it is the only game that I have access to that has 200+ lines of code
	(Most of projects have 100> because they are just small projects or random ideas. Either that or it was a commission for someone else)
